# unityCourseGames
Games built whilst learning how to use Unity in a Udemy course

This repository will contain ONLY the final projects from the course "Learn to Code by Making Games - Complete C# Unity Developer" on Udemy. All other resources, such as course text, videos, etc. won't be published here.

My intention with this repo is so that it may help people that are doing the same course or that are curious as to how I've done the games to see how I built them.

This repo will contain the follwing projects:
1. Number Wizzard Console
2. Text 101
3. Number Wizzard UI
4. ...

## Number Wizzard Console
This game is the first I've made and only uses the console and key press detectors to interact with the user.
In this game, the user has to think of a number between 1 and 1000 and the computer will try to guess it depending on the hints that the user gives (it's too high or too low).

For a somewhat experienced C# developer, this wasn't really new or hard. However, there was still some challenge regarding the way to program for Unity and how to write scripts for it. Basically, I found it to be a very interesting project to get used to this new environment.
